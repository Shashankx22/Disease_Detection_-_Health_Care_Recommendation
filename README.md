# Disease_Detection_and_Health_Care_Recommendation<br /><br />


Mini Project on Machine Learning based Disease Detection and Health-Care Recommendation System<br /><br />




Welcome to the Disease Detection and Health Care Recommendation System project repository. This project is a machine learning-based web application that allows users to enter symptoms and receive predictions for possible diseases along with recommended treatments, risk levels, and suggested doctors. It aims to provide early detection and optimal care recommendations to users based on their symptoms.<br /><br />



Features<br /><br />


Symptom Input: Users can enter symptoms in a text box and submit them for analysis.<br />

Disease Prediction: The application uses a trained machine learning model to predict possible diseases based on the entered symptoms.<br />

Health Care Recommendations: Provides recommended treatments, doctors, and risk levels associated with the predicted diseases.<br />

Probability of Prediction: Displays the probability of the predicted disease.<br />

Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.<br />
